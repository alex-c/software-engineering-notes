# Scrum vs. Kanban

**Kanban** is all about visualizing your work, limiting work in progress, and maximizing efficiency(or flow). Kanban teams focus on reducing the time it takes to take a project(or user story) from start to finish. They do this by using a kanban board and continuously improving their flow of work. 

**Scrum** teams commit to ship working software through set intervals called sprints. Their goal is to create learning loops to quickly gather and integrate customer feedback. Scrum teams adopt specific roles, create special artifacts, and hold regular ceremonies to keep things moving forward. Scrum is best defined in The Scrum Guide.

||Scrun|Kanban|
|-|-|-|
|Cadence|Regular fixed length sprints (ie, 2 weeks)|Continuous flow|
|Release methodology|At the end of each sprint|Continuous delivery|
|Roles|Product owner, scrum master, development team|No required roles|
|Key metrics|Velocity|Lead time, cycle time, WIP|
|Change philosophy|Teams should not make changes during the sprint|Change can happen at any time |
