# Kanban

Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile software development. It requires real-time communication of capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state of every piece of work at any time.

## Kanban Board

A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize efficiency (or flow). Kanban boards use cards, columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

Elements of a Kanban board:

- **Visual Signals:** One of the first things you’ll notice about a kanban board are the visual cards (stickies, tickets, or otherwise). Kanban teams write all of their projects and work items onto cards, usually one per card. For agile teams, each card could encapsulate one user story. Once on the board, these visual signals help teammates and stakeholders quickly understand what the team is working on.
- **Columns:** Another hallmark of the kanban board are the columns. Each column represents a specific activity that together compose a “workflow”. Cards flow through the workflow until completion. Workflows can be as simple as “To Do,” “In Progress,” “Complete,” or much more complex.
- **Work In Progress (WIP) Limits:** WIP limits are the maximum number of cards that can be in one column at any given time. A column with a WIP limit of three cannot have more than three cards in it. When the column is “maxed-out” the team needs to swarm on those cards and move them forward before new cards can move into that stage of the workflow. These WIP limits are critical for exposing bottlenecks in the workflow and maximizing flow. WIP limits give you an early warning sign that you committed to too much work.
- **Commitment point:** Kanban teams often have a backlog for their board. This is where customers and teammates put ideas for projects that the team can pick up when they are ready. The commitment point is the moment when an idea is picked up by the team and work starts on the project.
- **Delivery point:** The delivery point is the end of a kanban team’s workflow. For most teams, the delivery point is when the product or service is in the hands of the customer. The team’s goal is to take cards from the commitment point to the delivery point as fast as possible. The elapsed time between the two is the called Lead Time. Kanban teams are continuously improving to decrease their lead time as much as possible.

###  Kanban vs. Scrum Board

The difference between kanban and scrum is actually quite subtle. By most interpretations, scrum teams use a kanban board, just with scrum processes, artifacts, and roles along with it. There are, however, some key differences.

- Scrum sprints have start and stop dates whereas kanban is an ongoing process.
- Team roles are clearly defined in scrum (product owner, dev team, and scrum master), while kanban has no formal roles. Both teams are self-organized.
- A kanban board is used throughout the lifecycle of a project whereas a scrum board is cleared and recycled after each sprint.  
- A scrum board has a set number of tasks and strict deadline to complete them.
- Kanban boards are more flexible with regards to tasks and timing. Tasks can be reprioritized, reassigned, or updated as needed.

## Cards

The kanban card quickly evolved into a visual artifact that tracks a work item as it flows through a workflow. At its core, the kanban card encourages teamwork by helping team members communicate and share information visually.

Kanban cards allow teams to:

- View important details about work items at a glance.
- Hand off deliverables smoothly and efficiently.
- Improve efficiency.
