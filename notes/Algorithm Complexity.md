# Algorithm Complexity

Time complexity is the computational complexity that describes the amount of time it takes to run an algorithm. It is expressed with the big-O notation. Some common complexities:

`O(1)`: constant time
`O(log n)`: logarithmic time
`O(n)`: linear time
`O(n log n)`: linearithmic time
`O(n^2)`: quadratic time

Generally, `O(n^a)` with `a > 1` is a polynomial time complexity.
