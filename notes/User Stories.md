# User Stories

A key component of agile software development is putting people first, and user-stories put actual end users at the center of the conversation. Stories use non-technical language to provide context for the development team and their efforts. After reading a user story, the team knows why they are building what they're building and what value it creates. 

User stories are one of the core components of an agile program. They help provide a user-focused framework for daily work — which drives collaboration, creativity, and a better product overall.

## Hierarchy

- **Stories**, also called “user stories,” are short requirements or requests written from the perspective of an end user.
- **Epics** are large bodies of work that can be broken down into a number of smaller tasks (called stories).
- **Initiatives** are collections of epics that drive toward a common goal.
- **Themes** are large focus areas that span the organization.

## Goals

User stories serve a number of key benefits:

- Stories keep the focus on the user. A To Do list keeps the team focused on tasks that need checked off, but a collection of stories keeps the team focused on solving problems for real users.
- Stories enable collaboration. With the end goal defined, the team can work together to decide how best to serve the user and meet that goal.
- Stories drive creative solutions. Stories encourage the team to think critically and creatively about how to best solve for an end goal.   
- Stories create momentum. With each passing story the development team enjoys a small challenges and a small win, driving momentum.  


## How to Write User Stories

Consider the following when writing user stories:

- Definition of “Done”: The story is generally “done” when the user can complete the outlined task, but make sure to define what that is.
- Outline subtasks or tasks: Decide which specific steps need to be completed and who is responsible for each of them.
- User personas: For Whom? If there are multiple end users, consider making multiple stories.
- Ordered Steps: Write a story for each step in a larger process.
- Listen to feedback: Talk to your users and capture the problem or need in their words. No need to guess at stories when you can source them from your customers.
- Time: Time is a touchy subject. Many development teams avoid discussions of time altogether, relying instead on their estimation frameworks. Since stories should be completable in one sprint, stories that might take weeks or months to complete should be broken up into smaller stories or should be considered their own epic.

User stories are often expressed in a simple sentence, structured as follows:

`As a [persona], I [want to], [so that].`

Breaking this down:

- "As a [persona]": Who are we building this for? We’re not just after a job title, we’re after the persona of the person. Max. Our team should have a shared understanding of who Max is. We’ve hopefully interviewed plenty of Max’s. We understand how that person works, how they think and what they feel. We have empathy for Max.
- “Wants to”: Here we’re describing their intent — not the features they use. What is it they’re actually trying to achieve? This statement should be implementation free — if you’re describing any part of the UI and not what the user goal is you're missing the point.
- “So that”: how does their immediate desire to do something this fit into their bigger picture? What’s the overall benefit they’re trying to achieve? What is the big problem that needs solving?

## Estimation

In agile development, the product owner is tasked with prioritizing the backlog–the ordered list of work that contains short descriptions of all desired features and fixes for a product. Product owners capture requirements from the business, but they don’t always understand the details of implementation. So good estimation can give the product owner new insight into the level of effort for each work item, which then feeds back into their assessment of each item's relative priority.

When the engineering team begins its estimation process, questions usually arise about requirements and user stories. And that's good: those questions help the entire team understand the work more fully. For product owners specifically, breaking down work items into granular pieces and estimates via story points helps them prioritize all (and potentially hidden!) areas of work. And once they have estimates from the dev team, it's not uncommon for a product owner to reorder items on the backlog. 

### Story points vs. hours

Traditional software teams give estimates in a time format: days, weeks, months. Many agile teams, however, have transitioned to story points. Story points rate the relative effort of work in a Fibonacci-like format: 0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 20, 40, 100. It may sound counter-intuitive, but that abstraction is actually helpful because it pushes the team to make tougher decisions around the difficulty of work. Here are few reasons to use story points:

  - Dates don’t account for the non-project related work that inevitably creeps into our days: emails, meetings, and interviews that a team member may be involved in.
- Dates have an emotional attachment to them. Relative estimation removes the emotional attachment.
- Each team will estimate work on a slightly different scale, which means their velocity (measured in points) will naturally be different. This, in turn, makes it impossible to play politics using velocity as a weapon.
- Once you agree on the relative effort of each story point value, you can assign points quickly without much debate. 
- Story points reward team members for solving problems based on difficulty, not time spent. This keeps team members focused on shipping value, not spending time.
