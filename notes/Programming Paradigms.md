# Programming Paradigms

See [Wikipedia: Programming Paradigm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_paradigm) for an overview of all programming paradigms.

## Declarative Programming

[Declarative programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Declarative_programming) expresses the logic of a computation whithout describing its control flow. Many languages that apply this style attempt to minimize or eliminate side effects by describing *what* the program must accomplish in terms of the problem domain, rather than describe *how* to accomplish it as a sequence of the programming language primitives.

### Functional Programming

[Functional programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_programming) is a programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm in that programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.

Note: [Functional Programming](./Functional Programming.md)

### Logic Programming

[Logic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_programming) is a programming paradigm which is largely based on formal logic. Any program written in a logic programming language is a set of sentences in logical form, expressing facts and rules about some problem domain. Language example: [Prolog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog)

## Imperative Programming

Imperative programming uses statements that change a program's state. In much the same way that the imperative mood in natural languages expresses commands, an imperative program consists of commands for the computer to perform. Imperative programming focuses on describing *how* a program operates.

### Procedural Programming

Procedural programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of the procedure call. Procedures, also known as routines, subroutines, or functions, simply contain a series of computational steps to be carried out. Any given procedure might be called at any point during a program's execution, including by other procedures or itself.

### Object-Oriented Programming

[Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which can contain data, in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods). A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated (objects have a notion of "this" or "self"). In OOP, computer programs are designed by making them out of objects that interact with one another.
